# tictactoe

This is my first real Ruby project. It's a 2 player command line tic-tac-toe game. The main takeaway from this project is its use of classes. The board and both the players are objects created from classes.

A live version of this program can be found on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@VincenzoY/tictactoe#main.rb). Simply click the "run" button by the top center of the page

This project is based of [TOP Tic Tac Toe Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe)
